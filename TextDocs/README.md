Stock website:
This project was developed as a learning exercise to help me acquire and practice various web development and data analysis techniques. It was not intended as a production-level project but as an opportunity to gain hands-on experience with a variety of tools and technologies. The project features a basic stock analysis platform that displays stock prices, company information, earnings reports, and market sector charts.

Purpose:
   1: The primary goal of this project was to learn how to:
   2: Structure a database and manage data using PostgreSQL.
   3: Fetch data from APIs and store it in a relational database.
   4: Build a backend using Flask to serve data and manage routing.
   5: Create a dynamic and interactive frontend using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
   6: Generate data visualizations with Matplotlib to display stock and sector performance.
   7: Integrate frontend and backend through GET requests to show live data on the website.
   
Learning Outcomes:
This project helped me improve and develop skills in:

   1: Database Design: Structuring tables, defining relationships, and optimizing data storage.
   2: API Integration: Fetching data from external sources and storing it in a local database.
   3: Frontend Development: Building a clean and interactive user interface with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
   4: Backend Development: Implementing server-side logic using Flask, handling data requests, and serving dynamic content.
   5: Data Visualization: Generating interactive charts and graphs with Matplotlib.

Demo
You can view a live demo of the project at [Live Demo Link].

Tech Stack:
This project leverages the following technologies:
   1: Flask: Lightweight web framework to build the backend and handle HTTP requests.
   2: PostgreSQL: Relational database to store stock data, earnings reports, and other relevant information.
   3: Jinja2: Templating engine for rendering dynamic web pages based on data from the server.
   4: JavaScript: Used for handling frontend interactivity and dynamic content rendering.
   5: CSS/HTML: For creating a clean, responsive, and user-friendly layout.
   6: Matplotlib: Used to generate charts for fund sectors.

How It Works:
   1: Backend (Flask): The Flask server handles the routing and logic for data fetching, processing, and rendering. It interacts with the PostgreSQL database to 
     fetch stock data and news articles.
   2: Database (PostgreSQL): The database stores stock prices, company earnings, and news articles. Data is fetched via API calls and stored in the database for 
     efficient retrieval.
   3: Frontend: HTML and CSS are used to create a clean, responsive design. JavaScript is used to fetch and display real-time data from the backend, updating charts and stock information dynamically.

6: To run project run following command
   1: .\venv\Scripts\activate
   2: python DatabaseServer.py
   3: Live server 

User features:
   1: Stock Price Tracking: Historical performance, and company summaries.
   2: Graphic Visualizations: Use charts powered by Matplotlib to analyze market data and sector performance.
   3: User Experience: Simple, intuitive interface designed for easy navigation and quick access to key stock market insights.

Known Issues
   1: The stock data may is not updated in real-time due to limitations with the free API. I've instead decided to make requests to API and then save all data in 
   a database given that this is only a learning project. 
   2: Some charts may not render properly if there is insufficient data. Example is Company Overview for TSLA & AMZN
